# Discord Bot Template

This is a discord bot template made by [Brainy](https://github.com/BrainyV)

# Setup

- To set up the bot, you need to get a bot token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

- Create a json file named config.json then copy the content from config.json.example.

- Replace `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot's token. The same with `owner` and `developers`.
- Now, everythings is ready. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Finally, you can now run `node .` to make your bot awake.
